# Queue Simulation - C Program

It is a university project for the subject "Data Structures" I did solo.

The M/D/1 queue refers to a queue system having 1 server, and the service time is deterministic, i.e. not random.

The M/M/1 queue refers to a queue system having 1 server, and it has exponential service time distribution.

Both programs will show at every client what is the current time, the time they arrived, the service time, and the completion time, i.e. what time the client got out of the queue. The program ends on 500 clients.
At the end of both programs, it will show the average waiting time for all the customers.

In the M/D/1 program, the average waiting time is much larger than the result of the M/M/1 program.
